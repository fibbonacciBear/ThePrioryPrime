# ThePrioryPrime

In this project, I found a 2926 digit prime number that displays the Woodside Priory High School logo when it is printed in a 22 by 133 grid! 

Prime numbers have always fascinated me. Ever since I learned about the Trinity Hall Prime and the Corpus Christi Prime, I wanted to make something like that for my high school. After a few weeks of coding, and a lot of trial and error, I was able to find this prime number.
